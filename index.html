	Hwabaraty’s latest song, Memeza takes the listener through a journey of African spirituality. He uses traditional southern African music elements fused with modern sounds to tell the story of a young man’s journey to self-discovery. Hwabaraty’s lyrics explore themes of loss, joy, women's empowerment, and love. Undoubtedly, this song has reaffirmed Hwabaraty’s position as one of the most talented alternative artists hailing from the city of kings, Bulawayo. With this song, it’s clear that Hwabaraty’s music is not simply a combination of sounds, but rather a spiritual experience to be witnessed by people of all backgrounds.

Julia Holter is a musician you do not want to miss out on. After seeing her on tour back in 2018 during her Aviary album tour, I can say she is the kind of artist that draws you in to the emotions behind her music. Although she has yet to release another full album since, she produced the song So Humble The Afternoon and released it to the public back in October 2020. This song could not have come at a better time with its release occurring throughout the ups and downs of the covid-19 pandemic. Julia uses simple chord balance and a variety of musical techniques to transport the listener out of their own everyday reality and deep inside the emotions of the story. The comforting melody composed is one I would highly recommend to help ease the stresses during these hard times.

        Jessie Reyez is an artist for the hopeless romantics and broken hearted. Her music speaks to the soul and she sings with power. After seeing Jessie Reyez at the Osheaga Fall of 2021, I fell even more in love with her music. Her performances are powerful, and there's a story behind all of her music. She will make you feel like you are not alone, or help give you the perfect song to blast on a great night out. Her versatility is unmatched!
